This repository contains the ME-405 term project by Ethan Gray and Wyatt Eberhart. The objective of this project was to develop and implement a control system for a differential-drive robot, Romi, using MicroPython. Romi was programmed to autonomously navigate a predefined course (depicted in Figure 1) by utilizing three primary sensors: an inertial measurement unit (IMU), line sensors, and bump sensors. These sensors were integrated with the Romi chassis kit and combined with Pololu motors and a Pololu power distribution board.

The system was controlled using an STM32 Nucleo-L476RG development board, which served as the main processing unit. Task execution was managed through a real-time scheduler, ensuring periodic execution with designated priorities. Within these scheduled tasks, a finite state machine (FSM) was implemented to enable Romi to know what section of the track it was on and react accordingly.
